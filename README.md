A lot of help from - http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com

To run the project, just import the project into Visual Studio. You'll also need to have SDL2, SDL2_TTF, SDL2_Image on your system (basically add the header files and link library in Visual Studio Project build settings) - Download the precompiled libraries for them and follow these instructions - https://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL/VisualC.html 

DLLs to run this project are provided in this repo (32 bit). If you want to make a 64 bit version, you'll have to swap out those dlls with 64 bit versions.

Pretty much done with this project, the main goal was to get a basic sense of how a game works, by trying out the game design patterns at gameprogrammingpattersn.com. Keeping it here so that next time I start a project, I can refer to this as a starting point (a lot of code here was used in simple-game-engine project).
