# BREAKOUT

Simple Breakout game written in C++ using SDL2. For educational purposes. 

Art Assets - http://kenney.nl/assets
A lot of help from - http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com

To run the project, just import the project into Visual Studio. You'll also need to have SDL2, SDL2_TTF, SDL2_Image on your system - Download the precompiled libraries for them and follow these instructions - https://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL/VisualC.html

Pretty much done with this project, the main goal was to get a basic sense of how a game works, by trying out the game design patterns at gameprogrammingpattersn.com. Keeping it here so that next time I start a project, I can refer to this as a starting point.
